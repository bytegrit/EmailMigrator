EmailMigrator
This repository provides a simple and efficient script to migrate emails between two IMAP servers. It reads email and password pairs from a file, then uses imapsync to transfer emails from host1 to host2.

Prerequisites
Bash: Make sure you have a Bash shell to run the script.

imapsync: The script uses imapsync for email migration. You can install imapsync on Linux using:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install imapsync
Project Structure
accounts.txt: Contains email and password pairs (one per line).
config.sh: Stores host information (host1 and host2) for the source and destination servers.
migration.sh: Main migration script that handles reading credentials and performing email migration using imapsync.
Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/bytegrit/EmailMigrator.git
cd EmailMigrator
Configure Host Information
Edit the config.sh file to specify host1 (source IMAP server) and host2 (destination IMAP server) values.

bash
Copy code
# config.sh
host1="imap.sourcehost.com"
host2="imap.destinationhost.com"
Prepare Accounts File
Create an accounts.txt file in the root directory with email and password pairs, each pair on a new line, separated by a space:

plaintext
Copy code
user1@example.com password1
user2@example.com password2
Make Scripts Executable
Ensure that migration.sh is executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x migration.sh
Usage
To initiate the migration process, simply run:

bash
Copy code
./migration.sh
The script will:

Source the config.sh file to get host1 and host2.
Read each line from accounts.txt.
For each email-password pair, use imapsync to sync emails from host1 to host2.
Example Configuration
accounts.txt:

plaintext
Copy code
alice@example.com alice_password
bob@example.com bob_password
config.sh:

bash
Copy code
host1="imap.sourcehost.com"
host2="imap.destinationhost.com"
Additional Notes
Error Handling: Make sure to monitor the output for any errors during migration. If you encounter issues with specific accounts, check the credentials and server configurations.
Security: This script reads plaintext passwords, so itâ€™s best to restrict access to accounts.txt and the scripts.
Password Requirement: For this migration to succeed, passwords must be the same on both host1 and host2. If the passwords differ, update them on one of the servers to match.
